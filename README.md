## Summary
This project took data from the General Social Survey to explore trends in income equality dependant on different demographic variables. In considering changes across years, different sexes, ages, races, and more variables (described below), we managed to identify which variables appear to play more of a factor and have more correlation to income. Money has a different value throughout time, so the conrinc variable was used to see income adjusted for inflation. We found that people for whom any of the following apply tend to have a higher income than those without: white, male, married, excellent health, and/or a graduate degree.
